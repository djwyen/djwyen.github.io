Hi! My name is Derek, and I am a PhD student at NYU working with [Sunoo Park](https://sunoopark.com/), [Benedikt BÃ¼nz](https://cs.nyu.edu/~bb/), and [Joe Bonneau](https://jbonneau.com/) in cryptography, zero knowledge proofs, and privacy policy.
Previously I completed my MEng at MIT working with [Hyunghoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/index.html) and [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) on cryptographically private algorithms for polygenic risk scores.
Before that I completed my undergrad at MIT in 2022 with a double major in computer science and linguistics.

My interests include cryptography, econ/CS, tech policy, and historical linguistics.
