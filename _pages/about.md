Hi! My name is Derek, and I am an MEng student at MIT working with [Hyunghoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/index.html) and [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) to retool existing algorithms for computing [polygenic risk scores](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/polygenic.htm) for superior genomic privacy. Guaranteeing a higher degree of security will enable broader-scale collaborations than is presently possible.

My interests include cryptography, econ/CS, tech policy, and historical linguistics.

I completed my undergrad at MIT in 2022 with a double major in computer science and linguistics.
