Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science, MIT, 2022
* B.S. in Linguistics, MIT, 2022
* MEng in Computer Science, MIT, 2023 (expected)

Research experience
======
* February 2023 -- Present: Student Researcher, Hyunghoon Cho Lab and Berger Lab
  * Implementing cryptographically-secure polygenic risk score (PRS) estimation in federated data setting
  * Developing algorithms for random variate sampling under homomorphic encryption
  * Security benefits promise larger-scale database collaborations and enhanced patient privacy

* February 2020 -- June 2021: Undergrad Research Assistant, Regina Barzilay Lab
  * Developed reinforcement learning approach for reconstructing proto-languages from daughter languages
    * Primary challenge is the combinatorial vastness of possible sound laws, even under our simplified, constrained model
  * Defined metric to quantify similarity of alternative proposals of historical sound changes
    * To our knowledge such a metric is novel; primary challenge is that functionally equivalent sound law sets may be formally quite different, and similarity is only coherent relative to a particular dataset of interest
  * Model achieves comparable performance to linguistic gold standard (89.5% of sound laws)
  * Supervisor: Jiaming Luo
